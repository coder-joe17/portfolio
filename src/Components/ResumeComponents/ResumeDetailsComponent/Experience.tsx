                            ASU's CIS program is all about where technology and business meet. The curriculum not only covers fundamental business concepts (accounting, management, marketing, supply chain), but also goes into software development (C#, .Net, JavaScript, SQL). Additional coursework covers ERP systems and fundamental IT.

                            ASU's BDA program covers a variety of data related concepts. Concepts such as data storage and flow (Data Warehouses / Data Marts, Slowly Changing Dimensions) are stressed early on. Upper divension content is more focused on analyzing large amounts of data through analytics algorithms (utilizing Python, SAP, Docker, Hadoop).

                            While I am primarily majoring in CIS and BDA, over the fall 2018 semester I began pursuing the software engineering curriculum because of my desire to strengthen my fundamental engineering knowledge. While I plan on graduating in Spring 2019 with my two degrees, I intend to continue pursuing the software engineering curriculum online on a part time basis after graduation. <br/><br/>

                            The specifics of the curriculum include discrete mathmatics, exposure to fundamental digital design, formal education in a variety of programming languages and paradigms (C, C++, LISP, Java). Besides core engineering, the software engineering program also focuses on software development project management and team projects.

                            The Cross Sector Leadership certificate is offered to the limited groups of students who are part of the Next Generation Service Corps (NGSC - See "Leadership"). While closely intertwined to the NGSC, the academic requirements for the certificate program include completing around 15 credits of courses regarding leadership, entrepreneurship, and cross sector collaboration. Those involved with the program are taught how to create value propositions that can bring together the public, private, and non-profit sectors to solve complex problems in the community.
